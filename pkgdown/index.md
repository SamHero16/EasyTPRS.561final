# Welcome to EasyTPR

This package simplifies making 'n' basis Thin Plate Regression Splines. TPRS are a method for reducing unseen spatial confounding. More information at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin_plate_spline. Using these packages is quite complecated, so this package wraps them up into an easy experience for someone less familiar with spatial methods. 

## Features

- Generate thin plate regression splines easily
- Visualize TPRS basis components
- Simulate Gaussian processes
