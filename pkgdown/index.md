# Welcome to EasyTPR

This package simplifies making and visualizing basis Thin Plate Regression Splines. TPRS are a method for reducing unseen spatial confounding. More information can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin_plate_spline. Creating TPRS is quite complicated with existing packages. This package wraps the process for an easy experience, ideal for someone less familiar with spatial methods. 

## Features

- Generate thin plate regression splines easily
- Visualize TPRS basis components (very important for TPRS intuition)
- Simulate and visualize Gaussian processes
